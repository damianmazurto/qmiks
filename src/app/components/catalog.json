The hare is convinced that he is going to win because he can run so much faster than the turtle. But the hare is too confident in his speed and goes off the path, thinking he has plenty of time still to finish the race. Will the hare make up for the time he lost, or will the turtle prove that “slow and steady wins the race?” This beautifully illustrated fable from Aesop comes down through the centuries to teach us an important lesson about steadiness.",
